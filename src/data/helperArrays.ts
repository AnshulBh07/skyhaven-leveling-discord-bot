  `✨ <@{userId}> just offered a rare orb to the Server Spirit!  
  Legends say when an adventurer boosts, a Potum sheds a tear of joy, a Venena loses 1 DEF, and someone finally drops a 2s weapon after 7 years.  
  Thank you, brave soul — the land of Toram shines brighter today.`,

  `🗡️ With a swift motion, <@{userId}> unsheathed their blade... and boosted the entire server!  
  As the stars realigned, everyone's stat points mysteriously increased.  
  Merchants started smiling, farmers got lucky, and even Zokzada gave a rare item with no complaints.  
  True power. True respect. Thank you for the boost, legend!`,

  `💎 The gods of Toram trembled...  
  <@{userId}> just unleashed a *Server Boost Lv.9999*!  
  A mysterious aura now surrounds the guild base — drop rates feel better, crafting success has risen, and even the bots in Rakau stopped for a moment of silence.  
  Your generosity will echo through time, adventurer.`,

  `🌀 “BOOST!” shouted <@{userId}> as they stood atop the walls of Sofya.  
  The wind howled, the chat lagged, and the boost was accepted by the ancient Discord core.  
  In return, the server gained +10 morale, +15 guild pride, and 1 extremely emotional Potum.  
  Thank you for the blessing, brave warrior.`,

  `🌠 A strange energy has filled the air...  
  <@{userId}> has boosted the server, and rumor has it their luck stat now permanently says "???".  
  If you suddenly feel happier, richer, and slightly better at dodging boss AOEs — now you know why.  
  Boost received. Gratitude transmitted. You are appreciated.`,

  `🧪 The alchemists of El Scaro whisper of this day —  
  <@{userId}> has performed the ancient ritual known as *Boostus Maximus*.  
  The result? Server-wide buffs, a mysterious glowing aura, and one extremely confused merchant shouting “S>Boost for luck” in chat.  
  Thank you for the power-up, friend.`,

  `🗨️ <@{userId}> didn’t just boost.  
  They struck the server with a Lightning Element Slash of Friendship +10.  
  In their honor, all Revita IVs now heal emotional damage too.  
  You didn’t have to go this hard, but you did. And we love you for it.`,

  `🍀 Somewhere deep in the Toram code, an RNG gatekeeper screamed.  
  <@{userId}> just boosted the server, and the luck stat cap has been broken.  
  Pets are dancing, bosses are dropping loot, and even LFP parties are less toxic.  
  This is a day to remember. Thank you, almighty booster.`,

  `🎁 A strange gift fell from the skies above Sofya...  
  <@{userId}>'s boost has triggered a rare event: “Server Vibes +100%”.  
  Expect smooth drops, fun convos, and 15 minutes of temporary peace between DPS mains.  
  Blessed be the booster.`,

  `🛡️ In a flash of light, <@{userId}> boosted the server — and the guild statues trembled.  
  Mochelo bowed respectfully. Venena smiled. Even King Piton admitted, “Yeah… they’re built different.”  
  Thank you, hero. The server stands taller because of you.`,
